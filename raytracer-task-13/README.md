## Raytracing

The ++-group have a raytracing week during DD1337, before LINALG. This causes the work to be lacking in quality due to 'us' not knowing any of the underlying math. Building raytracers are fun(!), but can be complicated!

By scheduling this over christmas, your're able to build everything from basic raytracers to complex monters of pure beauty.

### Prepare Assignment

1) Create a repository named `<KTH_ID>-task-13` under the `INDAPlus22` organisation and clone it.
2) Navigate into your newly created repository and start writing.
    - Implement a raytrace.
    - That's it.

**Goldstar** for the Rustacean who still stick to Rust. Rust is not mandatory in any way, I just like it. Anything but Java goes. See [the absolute chad of indaplusplus19 - Eskil -'s raytracer](https://github.com/default-username-852/raytracer) in Rust.

**Note**: You may implemet your solution using any language (this includes Python *_host_ psudokod *_host_ *_host_).

### Grading

Because your solution can be implemented using any language, write in a README file of how to build and run your application (that includes how to run your frontend application).

**NOTERA(!)**: We demand readable raytracers, not compact ones!
